What if parallel worlds existed?

What if we could visit parallel worlds?

What if...What if...What if...

BUT is it real?

Jen:

"WHOOSH,"the wind blew. I stood on a small sandy beach with waves twice the size of me. The sky was as dark as an empty void, slowly sucking the soul out of my body.
My legs gave way and i kneeled on the soft, white sand. I can hear my family calling me in the distance, but I can't shout. My mouth was sealed shut.
A huge wave engulfed my limp body as I slowly lost my consciousness.

"JEN, WAKE UP!"

I jumped out of my bed as if my bed had a bug on it. My brother, Justin, stood at the foot of bed looking worried. That was when i realised my bed was drenched in sweat!
My pyjamas stuck to my body and my hair was dripping sweat. It was as if a huge wave had crashed into me. Justin 

(Justin asked what happened to you, then you answer with a lie or truth. Up to you to decide what you want)
