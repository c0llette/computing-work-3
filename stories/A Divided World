It's the year 3000. People said that mankind would be living underwater, flying in the skies or living with talking animals.
But no.
Instead, world war 3 has happened, civilizations have fallen and families have been torn apart. Countries have been split evenly. Half for adults and the other for those under 18. 
Why?
“Children deserve to be free from torment. Let the adults fight amongst themselves,” the great leader announced. And from then on, fate was changed. People scrambled to their families for 
one final look, a word of goodbye. Meanwhile, the great leader received backlash, hatred and some seeked revenge for their families. One day after that announcement, the great leader vanished, was gone,
Forever.
I was one of those who loathed him, seeked revenge.
The great leader. 
My father.

It was the year 3000. I was 17. In approximately 53 days, I would have to migrate to the other side of the border. My siblings, James and Jillian were beside me. James was 7, he still had a long way before hell, while Jillian was 13, not too far behind me.
My only concern about my departure was that my dear brother and sister would be left defenseless. Other than that, nothing else mattered.
“Bro! Why are you standing here! Come join us! Sis found a crab!”
“Alright I’ll come over!”
Not everything has changed on this side of the wall after all.

14 more days till I leave.
I’ve never really noticed my surroundings as much as I do now. Children are happier without adults. Children are more free without an extremely pressuring system. But is their childhood complete?
No. It isn’t
They grow up without protection, without a complete family.
Again, my siblings call for me and I race to their side.
I’ll protect them. But for not much longer…
